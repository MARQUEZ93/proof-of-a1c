# Proof of A1C

https://www.proofofa1c.com/

Proof of A1C is a proof of concept Ethereum project. It was a personal project as I learned how to interact with Ethereum. It aimed to encourage healthy blood sugar averages via Ethereum payments!

## Web3/Ethereum/ChainLink

The project requires users to have a MetaMask chrome extension.

## Dexcom API

The project interacted with the Dexcom 3rd Party API to query blood sugar averages.

## Testing

I used myself as the test user. I am Type 1 Diabetic, and have a Dexcom CGM. I placed my blood sugar on the Ethereum Test Network!

## Design/UX

My friend Bryan Murren provided mockups for the UI.
